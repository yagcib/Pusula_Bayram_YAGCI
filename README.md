## Overview

This project aims to analyze drug side effects using the provided dataset and `main.py` code. The primary objective is to perform in-depth analysis and predictive modeling to explore correlations and trends within the dataset.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: This script contains the code for data analysis and predictive modeling.
- `side_effect_data.xlsx`: This Excel file contains the dataset for the case study, including details of drug side effects.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib (optional, for visualizations)

You can install the required libraries by running:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Instructions to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url.git
   cd your-repo-directory
   ```

2. Ensure that the dataset `side_effect_data.xlsx` is located in the same directory as `main.py`.

3. Run the analysis script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. The results of the analysis, along with any visualizations or models, will be printed to the console or saved as files, depending on the code's implementation.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that the dataset is in the correct format and matches the columns expected by the script.
- If you wish to modify the code or apply different models, edit the `main.py` file accordingly.
